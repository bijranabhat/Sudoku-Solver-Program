Logic and SudokuFor those of you who don’t know how to solve a Sudoku problem, here is a brief explanation of the rules:* The game board consists of a 9x9 grid, further broken down into a 3x3 set of smaller 3x3 grids (see the example below) with each individual cell of the grid to eventually contain a digit between 1 and 9.* The final goal is to fill the board with digits so that all of the following are true:o Each row of 9 cells contains the digits 1 through 9 in some order with no repeats or omissions.o Each column of 9 cells contains the digits 1 through 9 in some order with no repeats or omissions.o Each of the smaller 3x3 grids contains the digits 1 through 9 in some order with no repeats or omissions.For example, here is an unfinished Sudoku puzzle:8673851463826327652759892871As an example of how to solve something like this, consider the third column of the grid (the one containing a 6, 1, 8, 7, and 9). This column needs a 2, 3, 4, and 5 to complete it. Consider the number 3 for a minute. The top empty cell (between the 6 and 1) is in a row that already contains a 3, so the 3 cannot go there. The second and third cells (between the 8 and the 7) are in a 3x3 grid that already contains a 3, so the 3 cannot go in either of those cells. This leaves the bottom cell of that column, so the 3 must go in that cell. Using similar logic, we can fill the rest of the squares in the grid.
The ProgramThis Program automatically solves Sudoku puzzles. It does the following:* Prompts the user to enter a file name.* Opens that file and read in the Sudoku puzzle contained within (the file consist of 9 rows of 9 numbers each, with zeroes representing the initially empty cells). Display the initial problem read in.* The program then solves the puzzle by filling in the empty cells of the grid. Displays the final solution.
